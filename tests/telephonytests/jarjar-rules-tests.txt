# Telephony-common has already included net-utils-framework-common lib and jarjars
# the package name. FrameworksTelephonyTests also includes net-utils-framework-common
# via net-tests-utils and tries to jarjar it again. Rename the package names with
# a different prefix in the test jarjar rule to avoid duplicate jar entries.
rule com.android.net.module.util.** com.android.internal.telephony.util.test.@1
# Similarly, this is needed for the build utils.
